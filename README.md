## 📖 Overview

**Chef Claude** is a smart culinary assistant that helps you decide what to cook based on the ingredients you have. Instead of searching through hundreds of recipes, you just list your products, and the AI (powered by Hugging Face) generates a custom recipe for you.

This project was built to practice **React 18** core concepts, including state management, side effects, and API integrations.

## 🚀 Features

* **Real-time List:** Add ingredients dynamically to your kitchen pantry.
* **AI Chef Intelligence:** Uses Large Language Models (LLM) to create professional recipes.
* **Markdown Support:** Recipes are rendered with beautiful formatting (lists, bold text, headers).
* **Responsive Design:** Works perfectly on your smartphone while you're in the kitchen.
* **Safety First:** Logic prevents sending requests with fewer than 3 ingredients to ensure quality results.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

* **Frontend:** [React 18](https://reactjs.org/) (Hooks: `useState`, `useEffect`, `useRef`)
* **Styling:** Custom CSS (Responsive & Modern)
* **Build Tool:** [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
* **AI Engine:** [Hugging Face Inference API](https://huggingface.co/inference-api)
* **Deployment:** GitHub Pages
